When the wick is lit, the heat from the flame melts the nearby wax, allowing the fragrance oils to evaporate and diffuse throughout the room. This process fills the space with a pleasant aroma, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.<\/p>"

            "answer": "<p>To use a scented candle effectively, trim the wick to about 5 mm before each use to prevent excessive soot and uneven burning. Light the candle in a well-ventilated room, away from drafts, and let it burn until the entire surface has melted to avoid tunneling. Extinguish the flame with a candle snuffer or by dipping the wick into the melted wax. Always follow safety guidelines by keeping candles away from flammable objects and never leaving them unattended.<\/p>"

            "answer": "<p>Please be advised not to burn the candle all the way to the bottom to prevent too much heat development. We have deliberately opted for a design that promotes the reuse of our candles for alternative purposes.<\/p><p>We recommend not placing the scented candle near an open window or door to prevent the flame from flapping or smoking due to the draft.

            "answer": "<p>Regularly cut the wick, with an ideal length 5 mm, of your scented candle and be sure to center the wick in the wax after each use for consistent consumption of the wax. Once the scented candle is blown out, the melted wax keeps its scent for a long time.<\/p>"

To minimize risks, choose high-quality candles made from natural waxes, and opt for those with natural fragrance oils. Always ensure proper ventilation and limit prolonged exposure in enclosed spaces.<\/p><p>Our scented candles are made from biodegradable, eco-friendly, and sustainable wax, combined with carefully chosen fragrance oils.

Factors such as fragrance intensity and storage conditions can affect their longevity. <\/p><p>After a year, the scent may gradually fade, but the candle will still be safe and burn effectively.<\/p>"
