            "answer": "<p>Lip gloss can last anywhere from a few hours to most of the day, depending on the formula and application technique. To extend the wear of your lip gloss, start by prepping your lips with a primer or lip balm, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/sophia-mae.com\/products\/eternal-balm\" title=\"https:\/\/sophia-mae.com\/products\/eternal-balm\">Eternal Balm<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/sophia-mae.com\/products\/balm-with-lip-applicator\" title=\"https:\/\/sophia-mae.com\/products\/balm-with-lip-applicator\">Balm with lip applicator<\/a>. Using a lip liner can help keep the gloss in place. Apply the gloss in thin layers, gently blot any excess, and add a second coat for extra shine and longer wear.<\/p><p>Lip Allure lip gloss offers long-lasting hydration and shine with a 3D effect while maintaining a non-sticky texture that remains comfortable for hours, even when layered.<\/p>"
