Do this carefully to avoid spilling any liquid. Flip the diffuser reeds, insert them into the holder and arrange them evenly. Place the holder in the desired location and adjust the number of diffuser reeds for the desired scent intensity. Again, do not expose the fragrance sticks to direct sunlight, and avoid placing them on a radiator, heating element, or a wooden surface. Avoid all surfaces where liquid can soak.<\/p>"
