Next, remove the trigger from the bottle and gently pour the liquid from the refill bag into the spray bottle. Be cautious to avoid any spills or overfilling. It is recommended to fill the bottle completely for optimal usage. Once the spray bottle is filled, reapply the trigger on the bottle and close it securely to prevent any leakage.<br\/><br\/>As you use the roomspray, periodically check the liquid level in the spray bottle. When the refill bag is empty, simply open a new refill bag and repeat the process to continue enjoying the fragrance.<\/p>"
